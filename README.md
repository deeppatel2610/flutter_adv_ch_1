# 1.4 Theme App

This project is a **Theme App** built using Flutter, focusing on implementing both **light** and **dark** themes. It allows users to switch between the two themes dynamically or adapt based on the system settings.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29d5d014-bda7-4ef7-9fd9-eee9b35981b1" width="300">

## How It Works

- The app uses `ThemeData` to define both **light** and **dark** themes.
- Users can manually toggle between themes or the app can follow the system-wide theme preference.
- The theme is managed using the `ChangeNotifier` pattern, providing a clean way to switch themes across the app.

### Customization

You can customize the colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of both themes by editing the `theme_app.dart` file. This file contains `ThemeData` configurations for light and dark themes.

## How to Use

1. The app starts with the system's default theme (light/dark).
2. Users can switch themes using the app’s UI.
3. The theme change applies to all screens instantly without restarting the app.
